# [Chemical Calculations](@id chemical_calculations)

You can now utilize the chemical properties fetched in the previous tutorial to perform various calculations, such as determining the limiting reagent and calculating theoretical yields in a balanced Catalyst reaction.

## Determining Limiting Reagent

As an example, let's consider the reaction `2Al + 3Cl2 --> 2AlCl3` and suppose we have the masses of `Al` and `Cl2` as 2.80g and 4.15g, respectively.

We begin by defining the species involved in the reaction and attaching metadata to them using the `@attach_metadata` macro.

```@example ind1
using PubChem, Catalyst

# Define the species involved in the reaction
@variables t
@species Al(t), Cl2(t), AlCl3(t)

# Attach metadata to the species
@attach_metadata Al
@attach_metadata Cl2
@attach_metadata AlCl3
nothing #hide
```

We then define the relevant reaction in Catalyst.

```@example ind1
# Define a balanced Catalyst reaction 
rx = Reaction(1.0, [Al, Cl2], [AlCl3], [2, 3], [2])
```

!!! note
The chemical reaction should be balanced.

We can then calculate the limiting reagent, provided we have the masses of the reactants.

```@example ind1
limiting_reagent(rx, [2.80, 4.15])  # Returns the limiting reagent and it's number of moles
```

## Determining Theoretical Yield

Similarly if we want to calculate the theoretical yield of `AlCl3` in the above reaction, we can do the following:

```@example ind1
theoretical_yield(rx, [2.80, 4.15], AlCl3) # theoretical yield in grams
```

## Calculating Molar Ratios in a Reaction

We can calculate the molar ratios of two species involved in a reaction. If we want to calcuate the molar ratio of `Al` and `AlCl3` in the above reaction, we can do the following:

```@example ind1
molar_ratio(rx, Al, AlCl3)
```

## Calculating Number of Moles

We can calculate the number of moles of a given species if we have its mass.

For example, if we want to determine the number of moles in 95g of MnO2 we can do the following:

```@example ind1
# Define the species and attach metadata
@variables t
@species MnO2(t)
@attach_metadata MnO2
nothing #hide
```

```@example ind1
moles_by_mass(MnO2, 95)
```

We can also calculate the number of moles of a species if we are given the molarity and volume of the solution.

For example, if we want to calculate the number of moles of MnO2 contained in 0.300L of 0.400 mol/L MnO2 Solution, we can do the following:

```@example ind1
moles_by_volume(0.300, 0.400)
```
